### Hi there, my name is Chris! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior full-stack developer, studying at Coder Academy!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my portfolio of personal projects and learning about the exciting world of code!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby/Rails, JavaScript/React, Node.js and Express.js!
-

- ðŸ’¬ Typically, when not coding you will find me playing video-games, reading (sci-fi or fantasy) or at a park throwing a ball around with friends!    


- âš¡ You can reach me by emailing me at chris.pb.scott@gmail.com and follow my coding journey at @code_with_chris on Instagram!
